', 'The key strategic regions SABIC caters to are Saudi Arabia, China, Asia Pacific, and Europe contributing 15% to 20% each  as of Q3 2023. As of 2022, the company has generated revenues amounting to SAR 198 Bn and an annual production of 56  MM tons representing an increase of 13.5% and 5.6% respectively from 2021 levels.   ', 'Petrochemicals and Specialities ', 'Revenues rose from SAR 149.9 Bn in 2021 to SAR 164.8 Bn in 2022, representing a 10% increase, driven by a 7% jump in  sales volumes and a 3% hike in average sales prices. The production volumes and Sales volumes in 2022 stood at 47.9 KMT  and 39.9 KMT respectively, representing an increase of 4.5% and 7.12%. On a 9-month basis, SABIC reported a 23.5% drop  in revenues in 2023 as compared to 2022. We reckon the decline is mainly due to excess supply dampening the commodity  prices globally.  ', 'SABIC has partnered with Formula E to develop the GENBETA car, this revolutionary electric race car would draw on SABIC’s  expanding portfolio of thermoplastics. SABIC has introduced bio-based versions of all NORYL resin grades to further  advance the bioeconomy of plastics. The broad range of physical properties of NORYL resins supports the needs of emerging  markets such as EV, Solar, Wind, and Batteries and essential industries including Water Management, Building and  Construction, and Automotive. The management believes that these innovations and partnerships with renowned  organizations will foster growth in the coming years for SABIC.

On a 9-month basis, SABIC reported a 47.2%  drop in revenues in 2023 as compared to 2022. The decline was caused due to a 44% fall in the selling prices in Q3 2023 on  a YoY basis.

We believe the decline is mainly due to the margin contraction faced over the last 4 quarters due to product  prices falling faster than the feedstock prices.

', \"Macro-Economic Factors and Global Prices  Global economic growth is projected at 3.1% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025, with the 2024 forecast 0.2 percentage points higher  than that in the October 2023 World Economic Outlook on account of greater-than-expected resilience in the United States  and several large emerging market and developing economies, as well as fiscal support in China. The forecast for 2024–25  is, however, below the historical (2000–19) average of 3.8%, with elevated central bank policy rates to fight inflation, a  withdrawal of fiscal support amid high debt weighing on economic activity, and low underlying productivity growth. Inflation  is falling faster than expected in most regions, amid unwinding supply-side issues and restrictive monetary policy. Global  headline inflation is expected to fall to 5.8% in 2024 and to 4.4% in 2025, with the 2025 forecast revised down.  China's economy faces a more challenging 2024, having expanded by 5.2% in real terms in 2023. There remain thorny issues  in the economy, including a continued downturn in the property sector, a debt overhang among local governments, elevated  youth unemployment, and deflationary pressures. Private consumption will be a major driver of growth, with the government  still relying heavily on public investments to realize its economic ambitions. IMF forecasts that real GDP growth will reach  4.6% in 2024 before decelerating further to 4.1% in 2025.  Following subdued growth last year, the EU economy has entered 2024 on a weaker footing than expected. The European  Commission's Winter Interim Forecast revises growth in both the EU and the euro area down to 0.5% in 2023, from 0.6%  projected in the Autumn Forecast, and to 0.9% (from 1.3%) in the EU and 0.8% (from 1.2%) in the euro area in 2024. In 2025,  economic activity is still expected to expand by 1.7% in the EU and 1.5% in the euro area. \", '91.9', '85.5', '93.0', '90.0', '75.8', '83.5', '78.8', ' -', ' 1,000', ' 2,000', ' 3,000', ' 4,000', ' 5,000', ' 6,000', '70.0', '80.0', '90.0', '100.0', '2/27/2023', '3/13/2023', '3/27/2023', '4/10/2023', '4/24/2023', '5/8/2023', '5/22/2023', '6/5/2023', '6/19/2023', '7/3/2023', '7/17/2023', '7/31/2023', '8/14/2023', '8/28/2023', '9/11/2023', '9/25/2023', '10/9/2023', '10/23/2023', '11/6/2023', '11/20/2023', '12/4/2023', '12/18/2023', '1/1/2024', '1/15/2024', '1/29/2024', '2/12/2024', '2/26/2024', 'Thousands', 'Volumes SABIC Stock Prices', 'Exhibit 1 – Global GDP Growth % ', 'China’s (Over)Capacity  China accounts for around 45% of the global demand for chemicals and petrochemicals. In 2022 China consumed almost  as much polyethylene as the rest of the developing world combined, despite having a population less than 30% of its size.  Following an end to the largest government stimulus package on record, and with weak export markets, an aging population,  and a decreasing household-forming demographic, demand began to contract. Growth in Chinese consumption across  most chemicals was in the low single digits or even negative in 2021 and 2022, despite widely being expected to be in the  high single digits, and this has contributed to the current oversupply.  Additionally, surplus chemicals capacity has been building in China since 2014, five years after the launch of a government  program to increase self-sufficiency in an industry perceived as high value. China currently accounts for 45% of global  chemical production capacity and anticipates achieving 62% market share by 2035, partly through export leadership but  also by focusing on innovative, greener products and higher-value specialty chemicals. In 2022, global overcapacity in the  six chemical building blocks averaged 191 MM MT (out of a market size of 2.3 Bn MT). That figure is expected to rise a further  10-15% by 2025 to 218MM MT.  Economies of scale have also led to China becoming a much larger producer of some fine and specialty chemicals such as  plastic additives. Given the reliance on plastic compounds as additives for their manufacture, this development will  significantly impact future supply chains and pricing.  Demand & Pricing  US-headquartered Dow recently said it expects challenging market conditions to persist through the fourth quarter but noted  some indications that things could improve next year as there seems to be an upward movement in the MEG’s spot price  and polyester production rates in China being over 70%, despite witnessing a decrease in prices by 6% globally because of  higher supplies and new capabilities. Price is forecasted to increase due to escalating feedstock expenses and an increase  in crude oil prices, driven majorly by the packaging industry.  In Q4 2023, the North American and APAC methanol market remained healthy with market dynamics affected by a strong  upstream market, elevation in demand, and low inventory levels. There seems to be a bearish sentiment across the  European and MEA markets due to high supply, low demand, and low rate of product consumption. The Methanol prices in  Q3 2023 decreased by 8% globally and are expected to rise to USD 2,655 CNY/T by the end of 2024.  For MTBE, prices increased globally by 17% in Q3 2023 due to an improvement in demand from the driving season. Prices  for the commodity were reduced in Q4 2023 due to sufficient product availability and weak cost support from upstream  markets. According to ChemAnalyst, the price of MTBE in the global market will oscillate as per the fluctuations in the ', '4.8', '5.4 5.6', '-0.1', '5.5', '-2.8', '6.3', '3.5', '3 2.9  3.2', '-4', '-2', '2000', '2001', '2002', '2003', '2004', '2005', '2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2010', '2011', '2012', '2013', '2014', '2015', '2016', '2017', '2018', '2019', '2020', '2021', '2022', '2023', '2024', '2025', \"Methanol market. In the Asian market, MTBE will remain plunged under the influence of a healthy influx of Methanol from  Saudi Arabia, reducing the production cost among enterprises.   Polyethylene prices decreased globally by 6% due to higher supply although prices in China were up by 1% supported by a  slight improvement in demand.   In the third quarter of 2023, the Middle Eastern Polypropylene (PP) market displayed a mixed pattern. Initially, the KSA PP  market experienced a 1.5% price decline primarily due to increased PP supply resulting from cheaper feedstock and weaker  demand attributed to the economic slowdown. Additionally, lower prices of PP substitutes further eroded its demand.  However, the latter part of the quarter saw a reversal, with PP prices increasing by 1.6% and 1.7% due to a bullish trend in  feedstock PP prices, closely linked to a 24% surge in Crude Oil prices. PP prices fell by 20.3% from 9,262 CNY/T in Feb 2021  to 7,380 CNY/T in Feb 2024. PP is expected to trade at 7,037.57 CNY/T in the next year.  Polycarbonate global prices decreased by 6% driven by lower government investments and weak recovery signals. In Q4  2023, PC witnessed bearish trends due to weakened demand from downstream industries and abundant supply. Prices are  expected to stabilize for the following year.   Feed Stock  Dated Brent prices are forecast to decline from USD 93/b in October to USD 81/b in March 2024, according to S&P Global  Commodity Insights, but with potential for volatility owing to geopolitical turmoil and economic uncertainties. Prices are  expected to rise after the first quarter of 2024. S&P Global's annual average forecast for Dated Brent is USD 85/b in 2024  and USD 76/b in 2025. Naphtha futures steadied around USD 660 per tonne, maintaining levels not seen in almost five  months, amidst growing concerns over supply due to escalating tensions in the Middle East. The ongoing Israel-Hamas  conflict shows no signs of resolution, while attacks by Houthi militants on vessels persist. Ukrainian strikes on Russian  refineries have also impacted one of the world's largest exporters, leading to a reduction of around a third in total exports.  Exhibit 2 – Brent Oil Futures \", 'Furthermore, US natural gas futures fell more than 6% toward USD 1.6/MMBtu on Friday, driven by abundant supply, ample  storage, and reduced heating demand amid a mild winter. Despite an Arctic freeze in January briefly impacting output, record  levels have been maintained. Mild weather has left stockpiles well above normal, with the latest EIA data revealing storage  22.3% above the seasonal norm. Propane prices held near USD 0.9 per gallon, like an almost 1-1/2 year high recorded on  February 1st, as demand remained strong and missile attacks in the Middle East fuelled concerns about shipments.  According to the latest EIA report, the US propane inventories dropped to 54.6 MM barrels on the week of February 16th,  down from 63.3 MM barrels in the same period a year earlier and marking the softest reading since the end of June 2022.

', 'Our Analysis & Recommendations  With disinflation and steady growth, the likelihood of a hard landing has receded, and risks to global growth are broadly  balanced. On the upside, faster disinflation could lead to further easing of financial conditions. Looser fiscal policy than  necessary and then assumed in the projections could imply temporarily higher growth but at the risk of a more costly  adjustment later. Stronger structural reform momentum could bolster productivity with positive cross-border spillovers. On  the downside, new commodity price spikes from geopolitical shocks––including continued attacks in the Red Sea––and  supply disruptions or more persistent underlying inflation could prolong tight monetary conditions.   Price decreases in Glycol, PE, PVC, and PP over the last two years are mainly due to geo-political shocks and excess supply  worldwide. The average decline witnessed in these prices was around 11.8% and 5.9% in 2022 and 2023 respectively.  Economists expect a decline of around 1.0% over the next 12 months. We anticipate headwinds to continue for the next  year, and then anticipate a recovery in global prices over the medium and long term.  Urea prices surged in Q3 2023 mainly due to production disruptions leading to supply shortages and rising demand for urea.  However, based on the World Bank, Urea prices will decline by 13% in 2024 as production recovers. DAP prices fell by 5%  in 2023 Q3 relative to the previous quarter and dropped nearly 34% over the past year because of the decrease in the price  of natural gas. As per the World Bank, DAP prices are expected to fall further in 2024 and 2025 as supplies recover and  capacity strengthens. Potassium Chloride prices decreased by 6% in 2023 Q3 relative to the previous quarter and remained  more than 60% lower than in 2022 Q3, impacted by sanctions on Belarus and Russia. After an estimated 55% decline in  2023, Potassium Chloride prices are expected to drop another 22% in 2024 before stabilizing in 2025. ', 'With global prices of Chemicals and Agri-nutrients witnessing downward pressures due to overcapacity and excess supply,  which is likely to have spillover effects over the next few quarters as well, we anticipate a ~20% decline in SABIC’s revenues  in 2023 and a marginal uptake in 2024.
